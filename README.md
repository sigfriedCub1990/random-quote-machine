### Description

This is one of the project from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine), I selected this project in order to `learn` a bit about [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

### Running the app

This app was bootstraped with `create-react-app` so, in order to run it:

```sh
yarn install
yarn start # This will run the development server
```

### Running tests

The main part of interest :), as I said this is the primary motivation behind this little project:

```sh
yarn test # Unit test for a helper function
yarn e2e  # Cypress e2e tests
```
